# University-Registration-System
A C# application that allows faculty and students to register and maintain courses

It was my group project for CSCI 421 Object-Oriented Design Course in Spring 2015 semester.

The project description and final report can be found in URS/bin/Release/

==== What I learned from the project ===
- Requirement Specification:
  + All the requirements need to be clear to ALL team members.
  + We should adapt to any unforseen change in the requirements.
  
- Design:
  + A careful design can save hours of coding in the implementation phase!
  + I applied the Entity-Control-Boundary pattern to allow a maintainable software.
  
- Implementation:
  + Although I have 3 years of experience with Visual Studio, this was my first time developing a C# application.
  + Using good variable and function names can make the code more readable.
  
- Testing:
  + Create and testing is a very important part because I discovered fixed many bugs during this phase.
  + Follow Test-driven development approach.
  
+ Maintenance:
  + After you complete the core features, you can move on to implement new features.
  + One step at a time!
  
=== Roles in the project ===

Kate helps designing the database and queries.
